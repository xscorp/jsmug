# jsmug - JSON Smuggler

`jsmug` is a simple PoC code for JSON smuggling technique. JSON smuggling technique takes advantage of insignificant bytes in a JSON document to smuggle arbitrary files.


<br/><br/>
## Usage

<br/>


### Compilation:
```bash
$ gcc jsmug.c -o ./jsmug
```

<br/>

### Encoding file:
```bash
$ ./jsmug encode <input_file_name> <output_file_name> <bytes_per_pair>
```
**Example:**
```bash
$ ./jsmug encode ./malicious-binary encoded-binary.json 20
```

In the below example, We encoded `naabu` binary in a JSON file named `sweet-document.json`.

### Decoding file:
```bash
$ ./jsmug decode <encoded_file_name> <output_file_name>
```
**Example:**
```bash
$ ./jsmug decode ./encoded-binary.json decoded-binary
```


In the below example, We decoded the `sweet-document.json` JSON file generated earlier to retrieve original `naabu` binary named `decoded-binary`.

## Background

<br/>

As per the [JSON RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#section-2), Certain bytes known as insignificant bytes are allowed at certain positions in a JSON file. These insignificant bytes carry no meaning in a JSON document and hence are ignored by JSON parsing tools such as `jq`. There are 4 allowed insignificant bytes mentioned in the JSON RFC:

* 0x09 (Horizontal Tab)
* 0x0a (New Line)
* 0x0d (Carriage Return)
* 0x20 (Space)

Since these bytes are invisible to human eye and also ignored by JSON parsers, These 4 bytes can be used for encoding arbitrary data or file. Same as we use Base 2 system for representing something in binary format, We can use a Base 4 sytem to represent data using these 4 bytes.

The above ASCII diagram shows how raw bytes are represented in their Base4 representation. Then those Base4 bytes are mapped to their respective insignificant bytes. Based on the `bytes_per_pair` specified, The Base4 symbol bytes are divided in pairs and placed at certain locations in a JSON document. The ability to specify how many bytes should be together assits in bypassing any detection rules written specifically for this kind of action.

## Credits

<br/>

The idea of smuggling files/binaries/data using this technique was based on an article by [Grimminck](https://grimminck.medium.com/) named "[*JSON Smuggling: A far-fetched intrusion detection evasion technique*](https://grimminck.medium.com/json-smuggling-a-far-fetched-intrusion-detection-evasion-technique-51ed8f5ee05f)". In his article, He demonstrates an undisclosed PoC for this techniqe, I thought it would be nice to try to create one myself.



<br/><br/>
## Notes

<br/>

* While keeping a lower number for `bytes_per_pair` would be nice to evade IDS, Please make sure you are using a higher number of `bytes_per_pair` for files of bigger size as it might lead to size calculations exceeding `size_t` limit ultimately resulting in a segmentation fault.
